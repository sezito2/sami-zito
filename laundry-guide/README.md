# NC State Laundry Guide

I came up with the idea to develop a guide for college students who had never done their own laundry before. Washing laundry with communal facilities is a unique experience. Along with my partner, we drafted a topic model to walk through the steps of washing laundry.

We developed three different user scenarios to guide our model. We used XML code to draft our models, YAML to edit the theme of the pdf, and plain language editing to ensure simplicity. 

A few months later, I revisited the laundry guide and redesigned some of the existing documents. I learned how to use Figma to improve the visual appeal of documents using NC State branding.
