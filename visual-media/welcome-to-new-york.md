# Welcome to New York (2023)

This short, amateur, video was made to critique the government of New York City and provide contrast to dreams and reality. Our professor tasked us with remixing audio, video clips, and news articles to create a new, critical video. 

The final video explores housing insecurity, quality of life, and policing. Some clips feature violence, **viewer discretion is advised**.
