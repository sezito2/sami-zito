# Non-Profit Coalition Development Course

My team an I worked with a local non-profit to develop an outline for a coalition development course they were developing. I created the outline for module 3 of the course. 

My team and I conducted a needs assessment, literature review, and interviewed an SME. With this research we complied our information into a comprehensive final course outline.

In my final course outline I included an overview of each section, estimated completion times, and a broad overview of the topics I believe the non-profit should cover in the final course.
