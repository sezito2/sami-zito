## Section 1: Characteristics of Successful Coalitions (5 minutes)

**Overview**: Ensuring your coalition is set up for success is crucial. In order to create social change, a coalition must be founded in a strategic manner. This section will cover some of the characteristics that promote a strong foundation for your coalition.

### Key Terms and Topics

* **Coalition Structure**

  * **Strong leadership**: Leadership can make (or break) a coalition. A coalition’s leadership needs to be strong, involved, and committed. Leaders are responsible for strengthening a coalition and supporting the organization. Leaders who were involved in decision-making often had more successful coalitions. Also, constant changes in leadership will harm a coalition, making it more disorganized. 

  * **Multi-leveled**: Having different levels of leadership can help appoint work and divvy up decision-making. In this case, it is important to implement feedback loops within the organization. Finally, a coalition can extend to multiple communities, encouraging a coordinated movement across a wider area.
  
* **Conscious planning**: Coalitions must carefully plan to increase their success and power. Also, be conscious of the availability and needs of your members (for example, only hold community meetings when necessary and have a set agenda; consider moving meetings to a virtual setting)
  
  * **Feedback**: Create a feedback loop between branches and levels of a coalition. This can also increase engagement among community members. Community members can provide their input on the direction of the coalition and what goals they want to achieve.
  
* **Cohesion**: Having a vision and mission statement helps orient and guide your coalition. This also creates a shared goal for both leadership and members which creates organizational cohesion. Provide members and leadership with rules and bylaws.

* **Trust**: Members need to have trust in the organization and its leadership. We will cover strategies for building trust in another section.

* **Diversity and Representation**: A coalition should represent diverse viewpoints from the community it represents. We will discuss diversity, equity, and inclusion in a later section.

## Section 2: Building Trust and Reciprocity (5 minutes)

**Overview**: One of the most important aspects of a coalition’s success is the ability to build trust between leaders, community members, and community institutions. Increasing trust can also encourage civic engagement.

### Key Terms and Topics
* **Building trust**
  * Leadership in a coalition should remain stable or ensure that power transitions are smooth. Frequent leadership changes can cause unrest, disrupting a coalition's objectives.
   * Historical racial divides can also be a source of distrust. This highlights the need for diverse representation within a coalition
  * Represent all sectors of the community in policy meetings. Do not exclude any group, this creates distrust.
  
* **Bridging Mechanisms**: These are people who help build trust within a coalition. These people are persuasive, charismatic, and caring, and work to bridge divides between community members. They unite and orient multi-racial or diverse groups.

## Section 3: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Coalitions (5 min)

**Overview**: A coalition needs to represent a diverse group of individuals; however there are some common mistakes that need to be avoided.

### Key Terms and Topics

* **Representation**: Include all groups in coalition efforts and communications and use data-based strategies to boost engagement. This also helps capture a community’s different perspectives
* **Mistakes to avoid**
    * No one should be the “token” or sole representative of an identity. This can reinforce negative stereotypes.
    * Pro-diversity messaging is viewed as unfair by the majority and condescending to the minority. Instead, base messaging around shared goals/values and reducing disadvantages for all. Highlight groups progressing towards the coalition’s goal and offer concrete actions to promote change.
