# IUD Data Analysis

This project is still a work in progress. I am currently working on analyzing my data and results.

As a part of my verbal data analysis class, I collected data related to patient's experiences with IUD insertion. I compared this data and to provider data. 

I investigated what type of experiences were indicated by patients versus providers and what type of language was used by these groups.
